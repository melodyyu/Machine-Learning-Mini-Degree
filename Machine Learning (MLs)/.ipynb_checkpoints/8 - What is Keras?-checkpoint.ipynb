    "## What is Keras?\n",
    "**Keras**: higher-level (diverse options, but limited specifiability) ML library aimed at rapid construction and deployment of neural networks\n",
    "- Provides a more abstract interafce\n",
    "- Takes a more modular approach by grouping functionality into objects\n",
    "- Can be run with other backends, but Tensorflow is the most popular \n",
    "\n",
    "### Its benefits: \n",
    "- Easier to use than Tensorflow (its modular approach makes it easy to build models layer by layer) \n",
    "- Has built-in functions to train, test and evaluate models \n",
    "- Tensorflow 2.0 is closely integrated with Keras and calls upon Keras functionality in many models and datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to obtain\n",
    "- Comes with Tensorflow or can be found under tf.keras "
